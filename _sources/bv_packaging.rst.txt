============

The *bv_packaging* program is used to install selected components from a build directory tree, and to make a binary package from them.

*bv_packaging* builds monolithic binary packages: one archive file (``.tar.bz2`` or ``.zip`` file) containing all the selected components. It is now replaced by the `brainvisa-installer <http://brainvisa.info/brainvisa-installer>`_ project, which actually uses *bv_packaging* under the hood to produce a repository of modular downloadable components and an installer program.
